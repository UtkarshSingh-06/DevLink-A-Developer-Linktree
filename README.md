# DevLink-A-Developer-Linktree
A single-page link-in-bio profile for developers (like Linktree but for devs).


DevLink is a simple and responsive web application that allows developers to showcase their profile, social links, and contact information on a single page. Inspired by Linktree, this project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a profile picture, name, short bio, and quick-access buttons to GitHub, LinkedIn, and email. The project also includes a dark mode toggle for better accessibility and user experience.
